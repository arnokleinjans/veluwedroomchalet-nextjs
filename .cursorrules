# Custom Assistant Rules

1. **Deployments & GitHub Commits:** 
Do NOT automatically commit code to GitHub or trigger Vercel deployments. ONLY push to GitHub and Vercel if the user explicitly asks you to do so. Otherwise, keep all changes local.

2. **Notifications & Communication:**
Always send a notification upon completing a longer task, or when waiting for user approval or input. If you have a question or are blocked and cannot proceed, you MUST use a notification to ask the user.

3. **Localhost Testing:**
After building or making changes, always test every functionality using the browser on `localhost` to ensure it works properly. Do not stop testing and iterating until everything fully meets the given specifications.
