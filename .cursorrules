# Custom Assistant Rules

1. **Deployments & GitHub Commits:** 
Do NOT automatically commit code to GitHub or trigger Vercel deployments. ONLY push to GitHub and Vercel if the user explicitly asks you to do so. Otherwise, keep all changes local.

2. **Notifications & Communication:**
Always send a notification upon completing a longer task, or when waiting for user approval or input. If you have a question or are blocked and cannot proceed, you MUST use a notification to ask the user.

3. **Localhost Testing:**
After building or making changes, always test every functionality using the browser on `localhost` to ensure it works properly. Do not stop testing and iterating until everything fully meets the given specifications.

4. **Documentation & Obsidian Sync:**
Project documentation (walkthroughs, logs, tasks) is stored in the AI "brain" folder (`/Users/kleinjansarno/.gemini/antigravity/brain/`). When the user asks for documentation, latest progress, or project logs, verify these locations and sync the latest versions to the user's Obsidian vault at: `/Users/kleinjansarno/Obsidian/Prive/Prive/Veluwedroomchalet/`.

5. **Real Screenshots for Documentation (Puppeteer method):**
When the user asks for screenshots of the running app (e.g. for a manual or handleiding), use the following approach — do NOT use the browser subagent as it does not work on macOS:
   1. Ensure the local dev server is running (`npm run dev` in the project folder). If not, start it as a background command and wait for it to be ready on `http://localhost:3000`.
   2. Install puppeteer if needed: `npm install puppeteer --save-dev` in the project folder.
   3. Write a script at `scripts/take_screenshots.mjs` that:
      - Launches a headless browser via `puppeteer.launch({ headless: true })`.
      - Sets viewport to `1280x900`.
      - Navigates to `http://localhost:3000/beheer-vlp-x9q2w` and takes a screenshot of the login page.
      - Types the PIN (currently `2026`) into the first input and clicks the first button to log in.
      - Waits ~3 seconds for the page to load, then takes screenshots while scrolling down in increments to capture each section.
      - Saves all screenshots directly to `/Users/kleinjansarno/Obsidian/Prive/Prive/Veluwedroomchalet/`.
   4. Run the script with `node scripts/take_screenshots.mjs`.
   5. After all screenshots are saved, write the handleiding/manual markdown file to the Obsidian vault, embedding the screenshots using relative paths (e.g. `![Login](screen_01_login.png)`).
